# Jenkins Pipeline for Dockerized App Deployment

This repository demonstrates a Jenkins pipeline setup for deploying a Dockerized application. The pipeline automates the process of building the Docker image, pushing it to a container registry, and deploying it to a target environment. This approach streamlines the deployment of your application in a consistent and repeatable manner.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) installed and configured.
- Docker installed on the Jenkins server or the target environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kartikdudeja/jenkins-pipeline-docker-app.git
   ```

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job:

   - Open Jenkins in your browser.
   - Create a new pipeline job and configure it to use the repository as the source.

3. Configure the Jenkinsfile:

   Open the `Jenkinsfile` and modify the variables to match your application and container registry settings.

5. Run the Jenkins pipeline:

   Trigger the pipeline job in Jenkins, and it will automate the build, push, and deployment process for your Dockerized application.

## Customization

You can customize the `Jenkinsfile` to include additional pipeline stages, testing, or specific deployment steps based on your application's needs.
